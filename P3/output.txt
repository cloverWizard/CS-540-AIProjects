 logan story by james mangold written by scott frank james mangold michael green final shooting draft august an lcd billboard with defective pixels a beautiful couple dance on a giant can of a redbulllike drink hypno the label morphs to different flavors ext a vacant lot night colored light from the billboard flickers over a bullet riddled sign route us border el paso texas beneath the sign is a long black limousine cars whip past on the highway then a van passes blasting some future version of techno latino hip hop a squeal of tires os now the music gets louder as the van returns cruising slowly past the black limo before pulling into the lot five bangers bail out and check out the black stretch the limo doors are locked windows tinted so they cant see whats inside but they check out the tires and wheels and like what they see with the speed of a pit crew they open the back of the van and out come tools and a jack int limo same we move over the back bench past empty bottles fast food wrappers as a sleeping mans face ratchets into frame he opens his red eyes the man is logan aka the wolverine or more accurately drunk wolverine he blinks dazed feeling the car lurching upward older than weve seen him he clutches a tequila bottle ext limo el paso highway turnout night as the back door opens the tequila bottle drops to the dirt and a booted leg steps out logan shuffles stiff to the other side of the stretch where the bangers work removing wheels lit by colored light logan uh please stop guys those those are chrome plated lugs they all five turn some pull guns on the drunk limo driver he just keeps talking slurring some logan contd youre gonna strip em plating flakes off you know a jittery banger cocks his shotgun final shooting logan contd its a lease you know and no one wants to pay to ride in a the jittery banger fires blows logan right off his feet logan contd fuck now might be a good time to talk about fights described in the next or so pages basically if youre on the make for a hyper choreographed gravity defying cityblock destroying cg fuckathon this aint your movie in this flick people will get hurt or killed when shit falls on them they will get just as hurt or just as killed if they get hit with something big and heavy like say a car should anyone in our story have the misfortune to fall off a roof or out a window they wont bounce they will die as for our hero with his socalled eternal life and healing well hes older now if you keep reading youll discover logans about to get his ass kicked but before we get to that we should make it clear his abilities aint what they were yes hes a drunk but hes also fading on the inside adamantium implants leeching into his system causing chronic pain and diminished healing hence booze as painkiller so by all means go ahead and worry about him now where were we oh yeah as the smoke settles a crowbartoting banger angrily chews out jitters in spanish for firing the others resume their work none aware of logan slowly getting up till logan contd guys seriously gets to his feet you dont wanna do this the bangers react to logan with bafflement adlib spanish reactions nervous chuckles crowbar presses down jitters gun as he moves to logan we hear a familiar snikt as claws slowly extend from one of logans hands then mostly extend from the other logan is still frowning at his bad hand when crowbar thwacks his skull a metallic ring off balance and pissed logan swings at them as they converge but hes drunk and soon they are pounding him with knives and guns and fists and a torque wrench final shooting he tries his best to keep them from the limo catches one guys bat an inch before it would dent the car another one of them shoots in that direction but logan puts himself in front of the bullet the pain from that little move stops him long enough for them to resume the pummeling suddenly logans eyes go yellow pupils dilating he lets out a long loud yell fury rockets up in him like cocaine he stands and rams his claws into crowbar and kicks another banger into the back of the open van yet another runs at logan only to get gored in the neck and tossed this is real work for logan not easy and it is fueled by rage jitters again raises his sawedoff he will nail the car for sure but logan slices off his arm above the elbow sadly for logan the hand while disconnected from the body it once belonged to is still holding the gun so as it hits the dirt the gun goes off putting several pelletsized holes in the door of the limo this more than anything else doubles logan anger logan contd motherf who gets hit once more and then goes after the last banger who seeing he had his chance leaps into the van and spins out of the lot his wounded compadre in back spilling onto the dirt as the van bounces back onto the road logan picks up his keys some loose change and a single silver bullet he stands staring at the holes in his otherwise pristine stretch as rain begins to fall he sucks in deep breaths forcing himself to regain control his eyes return to normalcy a phone vibrates os logan takes out his looks at it hes got a fare kicks the jack from the under the chassis we crane up as logan starts up the stretch and makes a loop in the lot taking care to run over the three remaining bangers before laying rubber onto the highway

this younger stronger version of himself the commotion distracts the two reavers guarding the children who raise their weapons a third reaver lines up a shot putting logan in his cross hairs when he is suddenly taken out by laura sensing their attention is elsewhere young bobby shifts his weight extending his finger eyes rolling in his head as final shooting an electrical bolt arcs off his finger
